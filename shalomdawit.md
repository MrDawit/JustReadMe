# Title: JustReadMe
an app to help construct a trivial README file

Live Link: https://github.com/MrDawit/JustReadMe 

## Description 
Readme files are sometimes long and tedius. Sometimes they are short and easy. Sometimes they are missing a whole lot of useful information that was just overlooked by the creater. For this reason, I have created an app that should make life easier for developers that need a general template of a README file that covers the most important parts of a README file that we sometimes forget (and go back to re-edit).
